**This document is intended as a starting point for anyone who is running DB benchmarks using SQL Bench.**

It will help one understand what some of the basic underlying assumptions are to ensure that
all benchmarks are valid and not misleading due to inconsistencies.

Always check and/or establish the following:

1.  Are you alone on the system under test?  You should be.  It is very important that equal system resources be available
to both tests.  System resource contention can lead to invalid test results.

2.  Are you using an OPTIMIZED build?  You should be.  The tests will run faster and the gain is what the customer will see.

3.  Are you consistently executing on an SSD or spinning drive?  SSD is the preferred method of execution.

4.  Are you investigating a potential performance regression from TokuDB build to TokuDB build?

5.  Are you investigating a potential performance disparity between TokuDB and InnoDB?

6.  Are you installing a build from a tarball (preferred method of procuring builds)?

7.  Make sure the TokuDB cache setting (tokudb_cache_size) and InnoDB cache setting (innodb_buffer_pool_size) are set to the same value.

8.  Understand if the test needs to induce I/O (out of memory) or reside fully in memory and set the TokuDB cache/InnoDB pool values respectively.
